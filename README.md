## Domain Understanding (Indian Road Transport Sector)

An overview of the Indian road transport ecosystem was studied using the Road Transport Year Book (2020–21 & 2021–22) to understand the structural drivers of commercial vehicle demand.

### Key Sector Insights:

- Road transport is the primary mode of freight and passenger movement in India, supporting trade, logistics, and industrial supply chains.
- Commercial vehicles (goods carriers, transport buses, and logistics vehicles) are closely linked to economic activity and infrastructure growth.
- State-wise variations in vehicle registrations reflect regional economic strength, industrial concentration, and logistics demand.
- Growth in commercial vehicle registrations often indicates expansion in construction, manufacturing, e-commerce, and rural connectivity.
- Government infrastructure initiatives and highway development programs directly influence transport demand.
- Economic shocks (e.g., pandemic recovery periods) can significantly impact year-on-year registration trends.

Understanding these structural factors provides context for interpreting registration data and identifying high-potential markets for dealership expansion.
